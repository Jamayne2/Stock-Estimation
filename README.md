# Stock Price Estimation Model

This project builds a machine learning model to estimate future stock prices using historical pricing data. 

## Overview

- Pulls pricing data from Yahoo Finance API using yfinance library
- Preprocesses data by calculating technical indicators like moving averages
- Trains machine learning models to predict next day closing price 
- Evaluates models and analyzes performance

## Models Used
- LSTM Neural Network (Keras)

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas & Numpy - data manipulation
- Matplotlib- visualizations
- Scikit-learn - model training 
- Keras - neural network 
- Yfinance - retrieving stock data

## Usage

To get predictions:
```
python app.py
```
